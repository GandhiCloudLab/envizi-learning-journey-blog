# A deep dive into reporting with IBM Envizi
In this article, get an overview of IBM Envizi ESG Suite, focusing on how it aids Sustainability Managers in capturing, consolidating, managing, analyzing, and reporting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data.

## IBM Envizi: comprehensive ESG suite
IBM Envizi is a SaaS-based ESG software. The IBM Envizi ESG Suite provides comprehensive data and analytics software to collect, manage, and derive insights from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sustainability data.

### Three pillars of IBM Envizi

Envizi is composed of three pillars to assist you at every step of your sustainability journey, be it consolidating data, streamlining reporting, identifying efficiency and emission reduction opportunities, or informing business strategy.

#### Data foundation

You may have been using a data management platform, Excel spreadsheets, or other internal systems, yet may still lack a robust data foundation. IBM Envizi offers a comprehensive set of data management tools to ensure the quality of data. You can seamlessly capture any necessary data for reporting and decision-making, consolidating all sustainability and energy data from across the organization into a robust and auditable single system of record, enabling you to report with confidence.

#### Reporting and disclosure

Reporting to both internal and external stakeholders while dealing with various frameworks can cause significant challenges. IBM Envizi addresses this complexity by offering a comprehensive suite of reporting tools, including dashboards and templates, designed to streamline the reporting and disclosure processes.

#### Accelerate decarbonization

By leveraging the insights offered on the platform, you can make informed, data-driven decisions, unlocking pathways to achieve your decarbonization goals.

### IBM Envizi modules

IBM Envizi is a modular platform, with a product framework comprising of 9 modules organized into 3 solution pillars, all supported by a robust data management layer. This modular and scalable functionality is designed to address your immediate requirements while offering the flexibility to scale up as needed.

 <!--- Comment : describe this image, provide brief writeup for the 3 pillars and the 9 modules (what are these/how can they be used) --->
<!--- Comment:Gandhi:response1 module details Updated. Pillars are already explained above.--->


The above picture shows the all the 9 modules. Here is the description about the same.

**Scope 1, 2 GHG Reporting + Accounting**: Take emissions calculations out of spreadsheets with an extensive platform built on the GHG Protocol, enabling you to prepare Scope 1 and 2 data for compliance or voluntary emissions reporting frameworks.

**Scope 3 GHG Reporting + Accounting**: Calculate Scope 3 upstream and downstream GHG emissions across your organization using all methods supported by the GHG Protocol including spend-based, average-data, hybrid and supplier-specific.

**Target Setting & Tracking**: Capture and track sustainability performance targets at any level of your organization with this comprehensive target setting and tracking tool.

**ESG Reporting Frameworks**: Upgrade your ESG data from spreadsheets into a robust platform which is finance-grade so your organization can meet reporting requirements.

**Building Ratings + Benchmarks**: Capture building attribute and utility data, calculate ratings, and benchmark and track building performance in one place.

**Risk + Materiality Assessment**: Analyze ESG performance metrics from your value chain stakeholders to measure their ESG performance and benchmark them with others.

**Value Chain Reporting**: A single portal to easily and securely collect ESG metrics from across your value chain to ease the reporting process.

**Utility Bill Analytics**: Leverage utility billing data inside a powerful analytics engine to analyze and control energy cost and consumption, identify anomalies, and inform decision making for energy efficiency.

**Interval Meter Analytics**: Automate the capture of high-resolution meter data and leverage sophisticated analytics and workflow tools, so your organization can drive efficiency and decarbonize across facilities.

**Sustainability Program Tracking**: Manage your organizationâ€™s sustainability programs in a consistent and transparent manner to track progress, verify results and optimize investment decisions.

## Data Management

The organization's operations are distributed across different locations, regions, business units, departments, manufacturing sites, suppliers, subsidiaries, and more. Organization needs to gather data from all these operations and guarantee the access to these data at any given moment. Lets see how Envizi is organizing the data.

### Organization Hierarchy

Organization hierarchy includes `Location by Region`,`Classification Groups`, and `Portfolio Groups`.

![](/labs/images/010-orghierarchy-1.png)


### Groups

Groups are  a collection of locations used for reporting or data access.There are two types of groups:

- **Classification Groups**: Represents the foundational structure of the organization. Each location must report 100% through the Classification hierarchy to be fully included in enterprise reporting. If a location is not part of a group, it will be excluded from most dashboards and reports.

- **Portfolio Groups**: Represents secondary reporting structures. A portfolio group may include some or all locations with varying report percentage allocations.

  Subgroups can be created under any of the groups.

Here, you can see the 'Classification' and 'Portfolio' Groups.

### Locations, accounts, and records

**Locations** describe buildings, properties, assets, or sites within an organization. Each location can have multiple associated accounts, capturing data from various resources.

**Accounts** capture, store, and report data from organizational resources, such as electricity, water, and transport. They are configured at a location level and associated with specific data types and account styles.

**Records** represent actual data from resources, such as electricity consumption for a specific account in a given month.

The Organization hierarchy displays the Group, Subgroup, Location, Account, and Records for easy reference.

### Categories, data types, and account styles

Envizi includes features such as Categories, Data types, and Account styles for grouping data, describing measures or activities, and configuring data schemas.

- **Categories** serves as a grouping of data types. Your organization is pre-configured with a default set of categories designed for tracking and analyzing data at an aggregated level.

- **Data types** represent individual measures or activities. Examples of data types include electricity, diesel, natural gas, refrigerant R12, water, employees, rail shipping, scope 3 emissions, business travel, rental car, and hotel stays.

- **Account styles** refer to the data schema configured on top of a Data Type. These styles are configured per customer, offering flexibility to meet diverse data capture requirements. 

The image shows the data type as `DIESEL TRANSPORT (MILES)` and the associated account style as `DIESEL TRANSPORT - MILES`.
